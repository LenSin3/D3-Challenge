This project uses D3 and javaScript to create a visualization of socio-economic indicators based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 

## Task

### Core: D3 Dabbler 

![4-scatter](/Images/4-scatter.jpg)

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

Include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in scatter plot and give them click events so that users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.

#### 2. Incorporate d3-tip

Use the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged)
